# r3cad
This is a CAD Software for railroad designers and engineers that simplify generating tons of technical and project documentation.

The designer inputs all the data and the program performs a routine work to draw the charts and drawings. This is a web-application based on HTML5 and SVG, so it works in any modern browser (even IE9+). Moreover, many designers are able to work simultaneously and see the result of their work on-line (like Google-Docs). The application supports https and login/password authentication.
